* Version 0.5.1
*** Latest SDK support (in progress)
*** Eliminate appengine-magic.core/in-appengine-interactive-mode?
    - send a message to the clojure-web-dev mailing list, requesting beta testing
    - close out tickets requesting IntelliJ and CCW support
*** Deprecate new* (maybe some Clojure 1.3 features will help?)
*** Blobstore size limits (SDK 1.5.4)
*** Prospective search? (SDK 1.5.4)
*** Datastore index retrieval feature
*** Remote API
*** Deferred API
*** Files API instead of the blobstore hack
*** Start using Ring's new multipart middleware
    - May not work: if that part of Ring loads, will it have classloader
      problems in production App Engine?
*** Datastore cursors
    Use .asQueryResultIterable in ds/query*, then store enough in resulting
    sequence metadata to be able to retrieve the cursor.
*** Async datastore requests?
*** Investigate MapReduce (for migrations, if nothing else)
